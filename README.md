# About Me

Hi, I'm Roman James Gonzalez, a junior developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites and applications. I recently graduated from University Of Texas At Austin Bootcamps where I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks and libraries such as React and Node.js.

During my time at bootcamp, I worked on several projects including a responsive e-commerce website, and a weather app that uses APIs, . These projects not only allowed me to apply my technical skills but also taught me how to work collaboratively with a team and effectively communicate ideas.

Prior to attending bootcamp, I worked in Commercial Diving Industry , where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that have proven to be valuable in my transition to web development. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field and am eager to contribute my skills to a dynamic team.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills, and I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. If you are looking for a junior developer who is enthusiastic, hardworking, and eager to learn, I would love to connect and discuss potential opportunities.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
