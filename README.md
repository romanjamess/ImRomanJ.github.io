# About Me

Hi, I'm Roman James Gonzalez, a junior developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites and applications. I recently graduated from University Of Texas At Austin Bootcamps where I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks and libraries such as React and Node.js.

During my time at bootcamp, I worked on several projects including a responsive e-commerce website, a weather app that uses APIs, and a social media platform that allows users to share their favorite recipes. These projects not only allowed me to apply my technical skills but also taught me how to work collaboratively with a team and effectively communicate ideas.

Prior to attending bootcamp, I worked in Commercial Diving Industry , where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills that have proven to be valuable in my transition to web development. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field and am eager to contribute my skills to a dynamic team.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills, and I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. If you are looking for a junior developer who is enthusiastic, hardworking, and eager to learn, I would love to connect and discuss potential opportunities.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
